// Thsrs - The Shorter Thesaurus

/*
Popular new social networking services like Twitter, where users write extremely short messages about whateverâ€™s on their minds, present a challenge: How can you intelligently get across a complex thought in just 140 characters without needing to use ugly abbreviations (e.g. â€œw/o needing 2 use ugly abbrevâ€™sâ€)?

If only there were a service that helps with the struggle of rewriting a 146-letter message to fit in a 140 character limit. Well now there is: Thsrs, the thesaurus that only gives you synonyms shorter than the word youâ€™re looking up. Just enter one of the longer words in your message, and Thsrs will suggest shorter words to use instead.
